#Simple Modular and test patterns DUE: April 5, 2016 by 1pm (class start)

##Description:
Using the node modular pattern this app greets your input via the command line.

##How to use:
In the command line type *node index.js anystring*
In this circumstance anystring can literally be any single string that your heart desires.
The command line should respond with *Hello anystring*

##How to test:
in the command line type *mocha*
This will run through the tests and tell you if they do or do not pass.
